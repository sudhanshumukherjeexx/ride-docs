### 📘 What is RIDE?

RIDE is an interactive, browser-based tool that lets users:

- Upload and inspect tabular datasets
- Perform data cleaning, encoding, and transformation
- Visualize data with 10+ built-in plot types
- Run statistical tests and outlier detection
- Perform AutoML for classification, regression, and clustering
- Chat with your dataset using OpenAI or Hugging Face LLMs
